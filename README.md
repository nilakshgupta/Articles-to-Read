The goal of this capstone project is to build a model that can recognize the dog breed given an image
of a dog. The inspiration for this capstone project stems from personal observation that the humans
are not that adept at recognizing the breed of a dog simply by looking at the image. The anticipated
market value of the proposal would be that businesses can use my application for targeted marketing
based on social media (Facebook, twitter etc.) posts.
